Slide 1 : What is causal inference and what is Causal AI?
Difference between them  
Specific Proof points - why do in New Frontiers


Slide 2:
As-is situations in chubb - 2-3 pointers 
What is currently happening in chubb?
What do we want to prove this POC? 
Advantages over traditional ML


SLIDE 3: 
What if analysis  on driving decisions on Reinsurance, exposure, CAT Modelling ? 
What problems can you solve ? Everything under one slide (Risk selection, Marketing , model customer behavior, meaningful statements  , strategy development
{ project the expected improvement in the business}

Slide 4 - How are other companies using this ?
Segregate Causal ai and causal treatment effect(inferencing)  
Allstate - (BFSI)
Jpmc 

table with logos (like netflix's - how they used )   ( can be put in slide 5 ) 
Connect with revenue , how much improvement in revenue ( number and percentage)


Slide 6: How much chubb can be improved 
Fraud rate -: 300 million $ identified 
If 10% more fraud - 10% of 300 M
Price elasticity
Portfolio optimization
90 million dollars - athena    -> Rupak 

-> projecting competitors strategies 


Causal analysis(what - if) on reinsurance and CAT Modelling)
Causal Analysis on Geo spatial Data -> can be linked with CAT modelling  (Catastrophic Modelling)
