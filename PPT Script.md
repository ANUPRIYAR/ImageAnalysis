Today I will be presenting on the topic LLM: Unlocking Lasnguage Potential.
In this presentation, we will be exploring various stargeies that can help in increasing the effecialy of Large Langiuage model for different usecases
## Slide 1
<p>So this is the Jouney Overview for the topics we will be going through 
First we will discuss about Tokenisation, How does it affect effecicy of Large Langauge Models .
Then we will disucss some key tokenisation algorithms :such as  Byte Pair Encoding which is as a tokenisation tecnique in Chatgpt , Wordpeice algorithm which is developed by Google and 
used in pretrained models such as Bert , Robertas etc.

So before we get into more discussion tokenisation, if any one can tell me is tokeinsation important for LLM models?
So tokenisation forms the foundation Large language models. SO how the model learns Linguistic patterns, Learn relationships between the words ,enhance viocablury of LLM Model.

These are some effects in the LLM model which can be attributed to the tokisation stratgey used in the Model.

So we now understood why is tokenisatin important.

Now lets do an overview how is tokisation performed ?
