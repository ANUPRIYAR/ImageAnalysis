## Example of Graph of Thought Prompting

**Example**: Consider a complex problem like planning a vacation. A Graph of Thought (GoT) approach would model the planning process as a graph where each vertex represents a piece of information (e.g., destinations, activities, budget), and edges represent dependencies between these pieces (e.g., how activities relate to destinations). The model can then navigate this graph to generate a comprehensive plan by combining and refining these thoughts.

## Analogy for Graph of Thought Prompting

**Analogy**: Graph of Thought prompting is similar to a brainstorming session where ideas are interconnected in a mind map. Just as a mind map allows you to visually organize and connect ideas, GoT models information as a graph, enabling the model to explore different paths and combine ideas in a flexible, human-like manner.

## How Graph of Thought Works

- **Graph Structure**: Information is represented as vertices (thoughts), and edges represent relationships between these thoughts.
- **Thought Generation**: The model generates thoughts and maps them onto the graph.
- **Thought Evaluation**: The model evaluates the relevance and coherence of each thought.
- **Thought Aggregation**: The model combines thoughts to form more complex reasoning paths.
- **Feedback Loops**: The model can revisit and refine earlier thoughts based on new information, enhancing the quality of the output[^3][^5].

# How does graph-of-thought prompting differ from chain-of-thought prompting

**Graph-of-Thought (GoT) Prompting vs. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- **Linear Structure**: CoT involves generating a sequence of intermediate steps that lead to a final answer, often in a linear or sequential manner.
- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Each step builds upon the previous one, mimicking human reasoning processes.
- **Sequential Output**: The model outputs a series of steps, one after another, to demonstrate its thought process.


### Graph-of-Thought Prompting

- **Non-Linear Structure**: GoT represents information as a graph, allowing for non-linear connections between thoughts.
- **Interconnected Thoughts**: Thoughts are interconnected, enabling the model to explore different paths and revisit previous ideas.
- **Holistic Output**: The model can generate outputs that reflect the complex relationships between different pieces of information.

In summary, CoT is more linear and sequential, while GoT is more flexible and interconnected, allowing for a broader exploration of ideas.

# How does graph-of-thought prompting differ from chain-of-thought prompting

**Graph-of-Thought (GoT) Prompting vs. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

### Key Differences

| **Feature** | **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | **Graph-of-Thought (GoT)** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Structure** | Linear or sequential steps | Non-linear, interconnected graph structure |
| **Reasoning Process** | Step-by-step reasoning, each step builds on the previous one | Thoughts are interconnected, allowing for exploration of different paths and revisiting ideas |
| **Output Generation** | Outputs a series of steps sequentially to demonstrate reasoning | Can generate outputs reflecting complex relationships between thoughts |
| **Flexibility and Exploration** | Limited to the predefined sequence of steps | More flexible, enabling exploration of multiple paths and revisiting previous thoughts |
