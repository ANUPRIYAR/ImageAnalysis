"Welcome everyone! Today, I'm excited to talk about Large Language Models and how we can maximize their efficiency through advanced techniques.

In this presentation, I'll walk you through several advanced techniques that can dramatically improve LLM performance and efficiency. 
We'll explore everything from the foundations of how these models work to cutting-edge optimization approaches that can increase its efficency to a even greater extent.

#### Slide 2: Journey Overview
"Let's take a moment to map out our journey today. We'll be covering five key areas that build upon each other to give you a comprehensive understanding of LLM optimization.
First, we'll start with the Foundations of Tokenization - understanding how LLMs break down and process language at its most basic level. 
We'll explore both word-level and subword-level tokenization approaches and why the transition to subword methods has been so critical.

Second, we'll dive into Advanced Tokenization Techniques like Byte Pair Encoding, which powers models like GPT and Llama, and 
the WordPiece Algorithm which was developed by Google to be used by BERT to handle rare words more effectively.

Third, we'll examine Advanced Prompting Techniques, including traditional strategies like Chain-of-Thought and the revolutionary
Graph of Thoughts framework that visualizes how LLMs reason.  ---> Need to rephrase

Fourth, we'll look at Parameter-Efficient Techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA that optimize large models while minimizing computational costs. 
We'll also explore prompt and prefix tuning for specific applications in fields like legal and medical domains.
Finally, we will explore a Distillation technique called Knowledge distillation- 
(the process of compressing knowledge from massive models into smaller, more efficient ones, 
comparing traditional fine-tuning with modern approaches to help you determine which method to use for maximum impact.)

So I am hoping , By the end of this presentation, you'll have a solid understanding of how to unlock the full potential of LLMs for your specififc usecase 
Now, let's begin with the foundations of tokenization..."


### Slide 3: Impact of Tokenization in LLMs
"Now that we've mapped out our journey, let's dive into the fascinating impact of tokenization on LLMs. 
As you can see on this slide, tokenization isn't just a technical detail - it's at the root of many curious limitations you might have encountered when working with these models.
For example : Why can't LLMs spell words correctly sometimes? Tokenization. Why do they struggle with simple string processing tasks like reversing text?
Again, tokenization. The limitations with non-English languages, particularly character-based ones like Japanese? You guessed it - tokenization.
The pattern continues across various tasks. 
Simple arithmetic, Python coding challenges, and unexpected behaviors like abruptly halting when encountering specific strings like '<endoftext>' all trace back to how these models process text at the token level.
Even seemingly bizarre issues - like warnings about trailing whitespace, models breaking when encountering unusual compound words like 'SolidGoldMagikarp,'
or the preference for YAML over JSON - all stem from tokenization decisions.
And yes, all these issues can be attributed to the fact that how  Tokenization was performed in these models
This humorous but insightful slide highlights just how fundamental this process is to understanding both the capabilities and limitations of language models."


### Slide 4: Understanding Tokenization
"Let's break down the tokenization process to understand what's happening behind the scenes.
This flowchart illustrates the journey from raw input text to the final tokens that an LLM processes.
The process begins with input text that undergoes preprocessing - converting to lowercase, removing special characters, handling punctuation, and normalizing the text.
These steps prepare the text for consistent tokenization.


After preprocessing, <strong> we specify token delimiters which lead to different splitting approaches </strong> :
(For example we have GPT2 tokrnizer which prefixes a special charcter G in fron of each word, then it performs the tokenisation. The we have Sentence peice tokenizer which prepends a _ in front 
of each word.)
space splitting for traditional word tokenization, subword splitting 
which we'll explore in depth shortly, and character-level splitting for the most granular approach.
The tokenization algorithm itself can employ various methods: rule-based approaches following linguistic principles, statistical methods that learn from data patterns,
or dedicated machine learning models trained specifically for tokenization tasks.
Finally, we have post-processing steps like stopword removal or stemming and lemmatization, which further refine the tokens before they're ready for use in downstream NLP tasks.

So This entire pipeline determines how an LLM 'sees' text, which directly impacts its understanding and generation capabilities. The decisions made at each step create both the
strengths and weaknesses we observe in these models."


### Slide 5: Exploring Key Tokenization Techniques
"Now let's explore the key tokenization techniques and discuss when to use each approach.
So staring with the word level tokenisation is splitting based on space, will give you word level tokenisation.
Word-level tokenization has certain advantages - it's effective for simple text in languages with stable word forms like English, 
<strong> where words don't change much based on their usage </strong> . This approach enables faster preprocessing and reduced memory usage in some contexts.
However, the limitations are significant. Word-level tokenization struggles with handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words effectively- 
imagine encountering technical terms or names not seen during training. And also for the languages which are morphologically rich , it cannot handle them very effectively, 
 < strong> where words change form based on tense, plurality( or number), or other factors. < /strong> . And if we try to handle those , , it's can be very memory inefficient 
 because it will have very large vocablury as each unique word needs its own token.

So In order to handle the limtations of word level tokenisation we can use Sub word level tokenisation
(So sub word level tokenisation comes to the rescue here.)
This is why the transition to subword-level tokenization has been so revolutionary. In contexts where word-level approaches fall short, 
So in subword tokenization we can break the words into meaningful segments. 
As illustrated in the right panel, we can see how different approaches segment the same input text.
(This method is particularly beneficial for addressing the limitations we just discussed, especially with rare vocabulary words and complex linguistic structures.)
So there are many tokenisation algorithms which uses sub word tokenisation.
The most common techniques include Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which powers models like GPT and Llama, and WordPiece, used by BERT - both of which we'll explore in detail in our next slides.
The visualization on the right shows how character tokenization, word tokenization, and subword tokenization each handle the same input differently,
demonstrating the trade-offs in granularity and meaning preservation."


###  Slide 6: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
"Now let's explore Byte Pair Encoding in depth - the tokenization algorithm powering many of today's most advanced language models including GPT and Llama.
What makes BPE so special? Let me walk you through it interactively. Imagine we're building a vocabulary from scratch, just as shown in the upper right corner of this slide.
We start with individual characters - our initial tokens.
Looking at our example with the word 'llama' repeated, BPE works by identifying the most frequent consecutive character pairs. 
In iteration 1, we see that 'am' appears most frequently, so we merge these characters into a single token. 
In iteration 2, 'ama' becomes common. By iteration 5, whole words like 'llama' have become single tokens!
This iterative merging process is precisely what gives modern LLMs their flexibility. 
The algorithm continuously counts the frequency of neighboring pairs, identifies the most frequent combinations, and merges them into new subword tokens
until reaching an optimal vocabulary size.
< strong > Let me pause here and ask: Have you noticed how this solves the out-of-vocabulary problem we discussed earlier? </strong > Even when encountering entirely new words,
BPE can break them down into familiar subwords, giving the model a fighting chance at understanding novel terms.
( so it will give the model a very good chnace to understand any new terms that comes up)
The diagram at the bottom illustrates this process at scale. When applied to large text corpora, BPE creates vocabularies that efficiently represent language
with a balance of common words as single tokens and rare words as combinations of subword pieces.
This is the secret sauce/ or technique  behind how models like GPT can understand and generate such a wide range of vocabulary despite having a fixed token set."

### Slide 7: WordPiece Tokenization Algorithm
"Moving from BPE, let's explore WordPiece - another subword tokenization approach that's particularly notable as the algorithm behind BERT, DistilBERT, and other transformer models you've likely used.
	• WordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba6707ec-b92d-4e71-8ed4-2d1d1f6759d5)

[[It’s very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently.
	• Thus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix.
	• Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. 
		○ The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fc6eabd-d636-47f0-8a4e-8ed5dc98b333)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08e4633e-a99e-402e-9752-aeb5751a56f6)
	• By dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586a4b88-161f-4294-86a3-6be61d11160a)


	•  Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like ## for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e77dd3de-1ca4-4e76-81e3-157f8566eaa0)
	• For instance, it won’t necessarily merge ("un", "##able") even if that pair occurs very frequently in the vocabulary, because the two pairs "un" and "##able" will likely each appear in a lot of other words and have a high frequency.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df5a706e-be5c-430c-b4ae-d8c502458a0f)  ]]

Similar to BPE, WordPiece breaks words into smaller meaningful units, but with some key differences in implementation that make it especially effective for handling rare words.


Let me make this concrete with an example. Look at the right side of the slide, where we tokenize the phrase 'WordPiece tokenization is a powerful technique in NLP.' Notice how 'tokenization' gets broken into 'token' and 'ization' - preserving meaningful linguistic units rather than arbitrary character combinations.
Here's how it works in four simple steps:

First, it starts with individual characters as tokens - just like BPE.
Then it iteratively merges the most frequent token pairs into new subwords.
It stops once a predefined vocabulary size is reached.
And critically, uncommon words get broken into smaller subword units.


Now, I'd like you to pay special attention to the advantages this brings:
[gesturing to each point with emphasis]

It handles rare and unseen words by decomposing them into known subwords
It achieves an efficient vocabulary size by finding the sweet spot between character-based and full-word tokenization
And importantly, it improves multilingual model performance by reusing subwords across languages

At the bottom, you can see BERT's specific tokenization process. Words like 'Playing' become ['Play', '##ing'] and 'NewYork' becomes ['New', '##York']. 
Those '##' prefixes are BERT's way of indicating that a subword piece appears in the middle or end of a word, not at the beginning.
What real-world impact does this have?
It means models using WordPiece can better understand technical jargon, names, and specialized vocabulary they've never seen in training - a critical 
capability for practical applications in fields like medicine, law, and science.

## Traditional Prompting Techniques ()
"Let's start by understanding the foundation of prompting techniques. As you can see on this slide, we have four key methods that have evolved over time:

Basic Input-Output (IO): The simplest form where we provide an input and receive an output with no intermediate steps. For example, asking 'What is the capital of France?' and receiving 'Paris.'

[Pause for audience interaction]
Question to audience: "Can anyone share an example of a basic prompt they've used with an LLM?"

Chain-of-Thought (CoT): This technique introduces intermediate reasoning steps between input and output. Instead of jumping directly to the answer, we guide the model to 'think through' the problem.

Key novelty: The introduction of visible intermediate thoughts within a reasoning chain.



[Interactive moment]
Example: "Let's try this together: How would you formulate a Chain-of-Thought prompt for solving a math word problem?"

Multiple Chains-of-Thought (CoT-SC): This approach generates several independent reasoning chains and selects the best one.

Key novelty: Harnessing multiple independent chains of thoughts, then selecting the most promising path.



[Demonstration]
"Notice how some paths lead to dead ends marked in red, while successful reasoning is shown in green. The model can abandon unproductive chains and select the best-scoring one."

Tree of Thoughts (ToT): This method allows branching from a single chain, exploring multiple paths simultaneously, and even backtracking when needed.

Key novelty: Generating several new thoughts from a given point, exploring multiple branches, and backtracking when necessary.



[Engage audience]
Question: "What types of problems do you think would benefit most from a Tree of Thoughts approach?"



## Graph of Thoughts  - The New Paradigm
"Now, let's explore the cutting-edge Graph of Thoughts framework, which represents a significant advancement in prompting technology:
[Build excitement]
"Graph of Thoughts or GoT represents a fundamental shift in how we model reasoning in LLMs. Unlike previous methods that follow linear or tree-like structures, GoT models reasoning as an interconnected graph."
[Explain with enthusiasm]
"In this structure:

Vertices represent individual LLM 'thoughts' or intermediate solutions
Edges show dependencies between these thoughts
The graph structure enables powerful capabilities through feedback loops, allowing for refinement and aggregation of ideas

[Highlight key advantages with examples]
"The advantages of GoT are substantial:

Complex problems are broken into manageable subtasks
Each subtask is solved independently
Solutions are combined effectively
Most importantly, this approach aligns with how humans actually think!

[Share concrete results]
"The results speak for themselves: GoT has achieved a 62% increase in sorting accuracy compared to Tree-of-Thoughts while reducing computational costs by 31%. These aren't just incremental improvements—they represent a new level of capability."
Interactive Demonstration
"Now, let's see GoT in action with a real example:
[Prepare for interactive demo]
"Imagine we're trying to solve this challenge: 'Create a comprehensive marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly product.'
[Walk through the graph formation]
"First, our input branches into initial thoughts about target audience, positioning, and channels.
Then, we refine each branch independently.
Next, we identify connections between branches—perhaps our audience research influences our channel selection.
Finally, we aggregate these interconnected thoughts into a cohesive strategy.
[Highlight the difference]
"Notice how different this is from a linear approach. We're not just following a single chain of reasoning but building an interconnected web of ideas that inform each other."
Closing and Future Directions
["As we wrap up, I want to emphasize that GoT represents more than just a technical improvement—it's a paradigm shift that brings LLM reasoning closer to human thought processes.
The future of prompting lies in these more sophisticated, interconnected approaches that can handle complex tasks while remaining computationally efficient.]



### Transitioning from Prompting to Efficiency (Bridge from Previous Section)
"We've explored how advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Graph of Thoughts can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities. Now, let's shift our focus to another critical aspect: maximizing LLM efficiency for specific tasks and domains.
While sophisticated prompting helps us get better results from existing models, what if we could actually tailor the models themselves to our specific needs? This is where we're headed next."
Enhancing LLMs for Task or Domain-Specific Use Cases (Slide 1)
"As powerful as general-purpose LLMs are, they can be significantly enhanced when optimized for specific tasks or domains.
[Engage audience]
Question: "Before we dive in, I'm curious: What specific domains or tasks are you currently trying to optimize LLMs for in your work?"
[Build anticipation]
"The challenge we all face is that while general models like GPT-4 or Claude are impressive, they may not be perfectly suited for specialized applications like medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or technical customer support without additional optimization."
Challenges in Training Large Language Models from Scratch (Slide 2)
"Let's first understand why we can't simply train custom LLMs from scratch for every use case:
[Point to the diagram]
"This diagram highlights four major challenges:

Computational Power: Training a state-of-the-art LLM can require hundreds of GPU-years and millions of dollars in computing resources.
Training Time: Full training cycles often take months, making rapid iteration impossible.
Data Collection: Gathering billions of high-quality, domain-relevant documents is impractical for most organizations.
Environmental Impact: The carbon footprint of training large models is substantial.

[Interactive moment]
Poll: "Which of these challenges resonates most with your organization's experience? Raise your hand for: Computational costs? Time constraints? Data limitations? Environmental concerns?"
"Given these significant barriers, we need more efficient approaches. Let's explore the alternatives highlighted at the bottom of this slide:

Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning
Distillation Techniques

These methods allow us to adapt existing models to our needs without starting from scratch."


### Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) (Slide 3)
"Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning, or PEFT, represents a breakthrough in how we can customize LLMs efficiently.
[Walk through the diagram step by step]
"Let's follow the process shown here:
Step 1: Pretraining

The foundation is a pretrained LLM developed using massive computational resources on broad datasets
This is the expensive part that's already been done for us

Step 2a: Conventional Fine-tuning

Traditionally, fine-tuning updates all model parameters
This requires significant computational resources
Even though we use a smaller dataset, we're still modifying billions of parameters

Step 2b: Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning

The key innovation: We freeze the original model weights
Instead, we add and train only a small set of new parameters
This dramatically reduces computational requirements while maintaining performance

[Make it relatable]
"Think of it this way: Instead of rebuilding an entire house to add a new room, PEFT allows us to build just the addition while keeping the existing structure intact."
[Practical application]
"This approach has revolutionized how teams with limited resources can create specialized models. With PEFT, a small team can fine-tune a model on a single GPU in hours rather than requiring a data center for weeks."


### LoRA & QLoRA (Slide 4)
"Now, let's explore two specific PEFT methods that have become industry standards: LoRA and QLoRA.
[Explain with enthusiasm]
"LoRA, or Low-Rank Adaptation, is an elegant approach that:

Injects trainable low-rank matrices into the attention layers
Keeps original model weights frozen
Dramatically reduces memory usage
Maintains performance comparable to full fine-tuning

[Demonstrate with the diagram]
"The diagram shows how LoRA works: rather than modifying the massive pretrained weight matrices directly, we add smaller matrices (WA and WB) that create a low-rank decomposition of the updates we want to make.
[Highlight practical benefits]
"The advantages are substantial:

3000x fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning
Faster training and inference
Much lower memory requirements
Nearly identical performance to full fine-tuning

[Share real-world applications]
"LoRA has enabled remarkable applications:

Financial institutions creating specialized models for regulatory compliance
Healthcare organizations developing clinical support systems
Multilingual companies enhancing language capabilities for specific regions

[Interactive demonstration]
"Let me show you some actual hyperparameters used in a LoRA implementation. Notice how few parameters we need to configure compared to full model training."
[Introduce the advanced technique]
"QLoRA takes efficiency even further by:

Quantizing model weights to 4-bit precision
Applying LoRA adapters to these quantized models
Enabling fine-tuning of massive models (65B+ parameters) on consumer hardware
Maintaining surprisingly high performance despite the compression

[Share impressive result]
"The most remarkable aspect of QLoRA is how it democratizes AI development. Models that previously required enterprise-grade infrastructure can now be customized on a single consumer GPU. We've seen researchers fine-tune 70B parameter models on laptops!"

###  Prompt Tuning
"As we continue exploring parameter-efficient techniques, let's look at Prompt Tuning, which represents another innovative approach to customizing LLMs without the computational burden of full fine-tuning.
Prompt Tuning is remarkably elegant in its simplicity. Instead of modifying the entire pre-trained model, we only add small trainable embeddings—what we call 'soft prompts'—to the input of a frozen pre-trained model. The beauty of this approach is that the original model remains completely untouched.
Here's how it works in practice: First, our pre-trained model stays frozen—no need to adjust those billions of parameters. Second, we add trainable prompt embeddings to the input text. Third, during training, only these prompt embeddings are optimized, effectively guiding the model's responses toward our desired outcomes.
The advantages are significant: It's highly efficient since it requires training only a small number of parameters—often just a fraction of a percent of the original model size. It's memory-friendly, working even with large models that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to fine-tune. And perhaps most importantly, it enables task adaptability, allowing LLMs to specialize in new domains like legal or medical contexts without comprehensive retraining.
Let's consider a real-world example: Improving ChatGPT for legal assistance. Instead of fine-tuning the full model—which would involve retraining millions or billions of parameters—custom soft prompts can be trained to better interpret legal queries, making the system more effective for specialized applications while maintaining computational efficiency.
As you can see in the diagram, this approach differs fundamentally from traditional model tuning, where separate models might be needed for different tasks. With prompt tuning, a single pre-trained model can be efficiently adapted to multiple specialized tasks."



####  Prefix Tuning
"Building on our discussion of prompt tuning, let's explore a more sophisticated technique called Prefix Tuning. This approach takes the concept further by working not just at the input level, but throughout the model's architecture.
Prefix Tuning is another parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique where trainable prefix embeddings—continuous vectors—are prepended to the model's activations at every layer. This allows for deeper guidance of the model's behavior without modifying its core weights.
The mechanics are similar to prompt tuning but with greater reach: The pre-trained model remains frozen, preserving all its knowledge and capabilities. Learnable prefix embeddings are added to each transformer layer's input. During training, only these prefix embeddings are optimized, influencing how the model processes text throughout its entire pipeline.
What makes Prefix Tuning particularly powerful is its flexibility compared to Prompt Tuning. By working across all layers rather than just the input, it provides more nuanced control over model behavior. It remains memory-efficient, requiring fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning. And it offers better control over model behavior, making it especially effective for specialized tasks like summarization or creative writing that require more sophisticated guidance.
To illustrate: Consider customizing GPT-3 for medical Q&A applications. Prefix Tuning trains specialized embeddings that guide responses toward accurate medical advice at each processing stage, rather than just influencing the input representation. This results in more reliable and contextually appropriate medical information.
The diagram on the right visualizes how prefix tuning differs from traditional fine-tuning. While fine-tuning modifies all parameters throughout the model, prefix tuning strategically adds small trainable components at each layer, achieving similar performance with substantially less computational overhead.
This technique represents an important step forward in making large language models more accessible and adaptable for specialized applications without requiring access to massive computational resources."

#### Converting LLMs to SLMs - Distillation
"Now that we've explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, let's shift our focus to another powerful approach for maximizing LLM efficiency: distillation.
What you're seeing on the right side of this slide is the essence of model distillation visualized. We're literally transferring knowledge from a large, computationally expensive 'teacher' model into a more compact 'student' model.
Think of this like education in the human world: the teacher possesses deep knowledge but requires significant resources, while the student can learn the most important lessons in a more efficient package.
This process is transformative for practical AI deployment. The large transformer model on the left—our teacher—contains billions of parameters and extensive knowledge. Through distillation, we create the smaller, denser transformer model on the right—our student—with fewer parameters that runs faster during inference while maintaining prediction quality remarkably close to the teacher.
[Pause and gesture toward diagram]
The beauty of this approach is that we're not simply compressing the model—we're selectively transferring the most valuable insights, similar to how you might distill complex information into key takeaways for your own presentations.
Ask yourself: How might your organization benefit from deploying more efficient models that maintain high performance but require significantly fewer resources? This is exactly what distillation enables.
In our next slide, we'll dive into exactly how this process works in practice."


###  Knowledge Distillation
"Let's unpack knowledge distillation in more detail. At its core, distillation is an elegant technique where a smaller 'student' model learns to replicate the knowledge of a larger 'teacher' model using fewer parameters.
The process works in three key steps: First, we train a large teacher model on our dataset—this is our knowledge foundation. Second—and this is crucial—we transfer knowledge not through raw labels but through soft labels and logits. These contain richer information about the teacher's understanding, including its uncertainties and the relationships it sees between different outputs. Third, we train a smaller student model to mimic these nuanced teacher outputs rather than just the final answers.
[Gesture toward diagram]
This approach offers several compelling advantages: We dramatically reduce model size—often by 75% or more. The smaller models process data more quickly, delivering faster inference when deployed. And perhaps most importantly for many organizations, this translates directly to lower computational costs and energy consumption.
Let me bring this to life with some practical use cases: Imagine deploying sophisticated AI assistants directly on mobile devices instead of requiring constant server communication. Or consider real-time applications where reducing latency from hundreds to tens of milliseconds creates a dramatically better user experience. And for specialized domains, you can create customized AI models that approach teacher-level accuracy while running on much more modest hardware.
I'm curious—which of these use cases resonates most with the challenges your teams are facing?"


#### Other Distillation Techniques
"Beyond basic knowledge distillation, researchers have developed several innovative variations that further enhance this powerful approach. Let me walk you through three particularly promising techniques.
First, data augmentation. This technique leverages the teacher model to generate additional training data, exposing the student to a broader range of scenarios. Think of it as expanding the student's education beyond the standard curriculum. By creating a larger and more diverse dataset, the student develops better generalization abilities—crucial for handling novel situations in real-world deployments.
[Pause briefly]
Second, intermediate layer distillation. Rather than focusing solely on matching the teacher's final answers, this method taps into the rich internal representations within the teacher model. It's like giving the student insight into not just what the teacher knows, but how the teacher thinks. By transferring knowledge from these intermediate processing stages, the student gains deeper understanding and often better performance.
Finally, multi-teacher distillation. Just as we might learn different perspectives from various mentors, this approach aggregates knowledge from multiple teacher models. The result is a student with more comprehensive understanding and improved robustness—particularly valuable when dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.
[Engage with audience]
Consider how these techniques might apply to your specific use cases. Which approach—expanding training data, accessing intermediate representations, or learning from multiple teachers—might best address your efficiency challenges while maintaining the capabilities you need?


#### "Key Strategies to Maximize LLM Efficiency"
Script:
"Let’s recap the three pillars that unlock the full potential of Large Language Models.
(Pause for effect, then click to animate each bullet point.)

1️⃣ Tokenization: The foundation! Imagine building a puzzle—every piece must fit perfectly. Tokenization breaks language into digestible chunks, ensuring the model processes inputs accurately and efficiently.
(Ask the audience): Raise your hand if you’ve ever encountered a translation or text error—chances are, tokenization played a role!

2️⃣ Prompting: This is how we communicate with LLMs. Think of it as giving clear GPS directions. A well-crafted prompt guides the model to the right answer. For example:

Bad prompt: “Tell me about AI.” ➔ Too vague!

Good prompt: “Explain how AI improves healthcare in 3 bullet points.” ➔ Precise and actionable!

3️⃣ Fine-Tuning: Custom-tailoring the model for specific tasks. (Gesture to the comparison table) Let’s dive deeper into how to choose the best fine-tuning method for your needs…"

"Let’s simplify this. Imagine you’re building a house. Each tool has a purpose:

LoRA is like adding lightweight solar panels—easy to install, minimal changes, but powerful! Perfect for multiple tasks without overloading the system.

Prefix Tuning is like a modular roof—adaptable for different weather (or tasks!), but requires careful setup.

Prompt Tuning? That’s rearranging furniture. Quick, low-cost, but limited to the room’s structure (your specific NLP task).
