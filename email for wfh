Subject: Request to Extend Work from Home to 3 Days per Week

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

Iâ€™m writing to kindly request an adjustment in my current work-from-home schedule. At present, I am working from home two days a week, but I would like to request one additional day (3 days total) to work remotely.

The reason for this request is that I am currently pursuing my M.Tech, and the schedule has become quite rigorous. On the days I commute, I spend approximately 3 to 4 hours traveling, which significantly impacts the time I can devote to both my work and studies. Additionally, many of my daily calls and meetings take place in the evenings, making it harder to stay focused after returning from the office.

Having one more day to work from home would greatly help me better manage my time and maintain productivity across both my professional and academic responsibilities.

Please let me know if this is something that can be considered. I assure you that I will continue to meet all my work commitments and maintain performance expectations.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
